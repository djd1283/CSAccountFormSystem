# CSAccountFormSystem

System to allow students to fill out a webform for CS account creation! Normally, students in the computer science department
who wish to create a CS account for accessing department resources must do it by hand. They walk to the IT office and fill out a form.
This was a class project from Network Security where we were tasked with creating a full stack application to create new computer 
science department student accounts in a fully online way. To test our knowledge of encryption methods, we encrypt all communications
between the client form, the backend node server, and a MongoDB database. 

This project was written using MEAN stack, meaning a combination
of MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node for frontend and backend. We borrowed code from an existing tutorial, and modified it to add additional
features, additional form fields and types, and encryption. We modified the database schema to allow for additional values, and added failsafe
mechanisms to avoid form spamming.
